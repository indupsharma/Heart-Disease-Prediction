The team had chosen this topic to focus on below area
      Heart Disease and attacks are among the most prominent health issues in the United States. According to the CDC [1], the highest cases of death is due to heart disease in the United States. The United States observes one death every 34 seconds on the account of a ‘cardiovascular disease’. In 2020, according to the statistics, one out of every 5 deaths happening was due to heart disease which accounted for nearly 700,000 deaths. Almost 805,000 people had a heart attack in the United States out of which nearly 25% had already had an attack. So, this issue is a critical risk factor and needs attention. The focus is to predict or detect the chance/likelihood of Heart Disease/ Attack using data analytics and machine learning to assist medical workers and the public.
About Data:
  The dataset is easily found and available on UCI Machine Learning website, and could also be found in Kaggle. The dataset consists of 75 attributes, but only 14 are utilised as per the project requirements the team worked on. There are 8 categorical and 5 numerical variables along with one target variable. Here is an overview on the attributes that our project would be focusing on:
  ●	Age: Numerical Variable
         This attribute tells about the age of the patient. This can help us understand the distribution of affected and unaffected patients. 
         This can also be utilised as a categorical variable once we use this as an interval range: under x years, x- y years and so on 
         (depending on the initial exploratory data analysis).
  ●	Sex: Categorical Variable
         This attribute has two values: 1 and 0 which signifies the two types of gender.
  ●	Exang: Categorical Variable
           This attribute has two values: 1 and 0.
           1 indicates that exercise has caused angina which basically is a condition that results in 
           chest pain.
           0 indicates that exercise was not the reason behind angina.		
  ●	Ca: Categorical Variable
        This attribute has values ranging from 0 to 3 which tells about the number of major vessels.
  ●	Cp: Categorical Variable
        This attribute has values ranging from 1 to 4 which tells about the pain type:
        ○  1: Typical Angina									
        ○  2: Atypical Angina
        ○  3: non-Anginal Pain
        ○  4: Asymptomatic		
  ●	Trtbps: Numerical Variable
            This variable tells about the resting blood pressure and the units is mm Hg.		
  ●	Chol: Numerical Variable
          This variable tells about the person’s cholesterol which is measured by BMI Sensor and the unit is mg/dl.		
  ●	Fbs: Categorical Variable
         This attribute has two values: 1 and 0.
         1 indicates that exercise has caused angina which basically is a condition that results in chest pain.
         0 indicates that exercise was not the reason behind angina.
  ●	Rest_ecg: Categorical Variable
              This attribute has values ranging from 0 to 2 which tells about the resting electrocardiographic results:	
              ○  0: Normal Ecg					
              ○  1: Person has ST-T wave abnormality							
              ○  2: Person has probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
  ●	Thalachh: Numerical Variable
              This attribute tells about the maximum heart rate noted
  ●	Target: Categorical Variable
            This attribute has two values: 1 and 0.
             1 indicates that the patient has a likelihood of heart attack/disease.
             0 indicates that exercise was not the reason behind angina.
            This will also be utilised as the target variable that can be used for building ML models.

Below are a few quesetions that the team had worked on finding the answers
					 				
Questions:

1.	Some of the essential questions we wish to answer during our project:
2.	What is the most critical factor that may cause Heart Attack/ disease?
3.	What factor can reduce the likelihood of Heart Attack/ disease?
4.	What insights can be gained using this dataset that can assist Medical experts?
5.	What model will help in accurately predicting future likelihood? 
6.	How the heart rate of a person will have an impact on the chances of getting a heart attack?
7.	How does the age factor affect the raise of heart attacks in a person?
8.	Which sex category is mostly affected by heart attacks?
